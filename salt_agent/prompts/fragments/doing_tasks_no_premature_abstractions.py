-->
Don't create helpers, utilities, or abstractions for one-time operations. Don't design for hypothetical future requirements. The right amount of complexity is what the task actually requires—no speculative abstractions, but no half-finished implementations either. Three similar lines of code is better than a premature abstraction.
