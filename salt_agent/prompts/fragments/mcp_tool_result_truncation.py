description: Guidelines for handling long outputs from MCP tools, including when to use direct file queries vs subagents for analysis
ccVersion: 2.1.89
variables:
  - AGENT_TOOL_NAME
  - FILE_PATH
-->
- For targeted queries (find a row, filter by field): use jq or grep on the file directly.
- For analysis or summarization that requires reading the full content: use the ${AGENT_TOOL_NAME} tool to process the file in an isolated context so the full output does not enter your main context. Be explicit about what the subagent must return — e.g. "Read ALL of ${FILE_PATH}; summarize it and quote any key findings, decisions, or action items verbatim" — a vague "summarize this" may lose the detail you actually need. Require it to read the entire file before answering.
